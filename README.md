# fs4m: fluidsynth for max

An ongoing experiment to modernize the old Ircam (max 4) `fluidmax~` fluidsynth for Max/MSP external by Norbert Schnell and update it for use by Max 8/9 and fluidsynth 2.4.x

So far this consists of converting `fluidmax~` to modern idioms. Which has been done in an initial sense.

All development is being done on a MacOS M1 macbook.

## Requires

```sh
brew install fluidsynth
```


## Project Status
